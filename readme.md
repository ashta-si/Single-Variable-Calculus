# Single Variable Calculus
#### 18.01 | Fall 2006 | Undergradute

These video lectures of Professor David Jerison teaching 18.01 were recorded live in the Fall of 2007 and do not 
correspond precisely to the lectures taught in the Fall of 2006 (e.g, the lecture notes).

**Note**: Videos were not recorded during session 8, 17, 27, and 33 as these were in-class exams.
